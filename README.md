# PrototypeSensorManufacturer

Played the role of a Sensor Manufacturer who would develop sensors for the new College of Computing and Data Sciences building at Boston University. Our company had to process the daily data of all of the sensors and send it to BU in an encrypted format. In no point in the process were we allowed to see the data and we had to provide some sort of zero knowledge proof system so BU can prove to the rest of the world that the data is accurate without revealing the data. A more detailed explanation of this process can be found in the attached report.

This project make use of homomorphic encryption, secret-sharing, and zero knowledge proofs.
